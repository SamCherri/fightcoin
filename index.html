    <h2>About the Project</h2>
    <p>Husky FC is the world's first football club created and funded entirely by a community through cryptocurrency and NFTs. Built on the Shibarium network, it's a decentralized, transparent, and inclusive movement. The club starts with its own stadium and is governed by DAO voting — fans are in control.</p>
